        <h1 id="title">NUS Exam Optimizer</h1>
        <p>According to student concerns, important exams are set too close together. This method will maximize the time between these examinations as much as feasible.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Please provide the following inputs:</h2>
        <br>
        <div id="inputSection">

                <h3>2D Arrays of modules</h3>
                <p>This data will be represented in a 2D array, and every subarray will represent the modules a student has taken together.</p>

                    <p>Suppose our dataset contains of students A, B, C</p>

            <p>We need to define what it means for a student's exam to be spread out.
                A metric that we could use is simply the average number of days between consecutive exams for all students.
                The metric as shown below will take in a student's schedule and find the average number of days.

            <p>Since we are optimizing the exam schedule for more than 1 student, lets define another metric that
                finds the total average of days between consecutive exams for all students.
